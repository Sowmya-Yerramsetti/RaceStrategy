predict the speed of the car from point A to point B 
(50 mile straight line starting at zero speed)

trying to optimize time without killing the batteries

current restraints:
    - max speed
    - battery charge
    - battery usage
        - decreases by 1% at 5mph for 1min
        - 0.00083333333 = d = 3/25
        - 0.01 = d(5)(1/60)
        - amount decreased = d(v)(hours)
    - desired end battery charge

should output:
    - best speed found
    - time
    - end battery charge

# battery_resistance = 0.1 # Ohms, add once current is found

# Assuming battery outputs 5KWh desired_end_soc implies = 0.5 KWH leftover
