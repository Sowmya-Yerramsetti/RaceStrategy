Aspects that can potentially affect solar panels output (incomplete):
    - Weather information (web scraping)
        - Outside temperature
        - Cloud coverage
    - Estimate of distance from sun
        - Magnitude and vector
    - Solar panel information
        - Number/area of panels
        - Efficiency of panels

Questions this should answer:
    - When is the solar panel getting more, equal, or less power than is being used?
    - What is the current battery capacity? We don't want to waste power.

Function:
    - Input: all aspects listed above
    - Output: estimated solar panel output, and compare to both current power 
      usage and battery capacity if solar panel output is greater than power being used
